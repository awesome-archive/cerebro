# Plugins

Cerebro plugin is just a javascript module. All you need is to write a function, that takes one object and call a function from arguments with your results.

> You should have installed node and yarn. If you don't have it: follow [this](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) instructions.

You can create your plugin using [create-cerebro-plugin](https://github.com/KELiON/create-cerebro-plugin) so you can focus on code of your plugin, not on tools and configuration around it.
